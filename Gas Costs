//This is a simple gas costs calculator. It takes in two user inputs, one for the mpg that the car gets and one for the cost of gas. The calculator will then return
//the cost to drive 10, 50, and 500 miles with the resepective inputs. With rising gas prices it is always good to know how much you are going to spend before you 
//begin your trip. This little project proved useful for when I know I am going to drive a longer distance and I want to estimate my gas costs.
